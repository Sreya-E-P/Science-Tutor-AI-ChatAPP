Health and Disease: Pathogens; parasites causing human diseases (Malaria, Filariasis, Ascariasis,
Typhoid, Pneumonia, common cold, amoebiasis, ring worm); Basic concepts of immunology–vaccines;
Cancer, HIV and AIDs; Adolescence, drug and alcohol abuse.
Improvement in food production: Plant breeding, tissue culture, single cell protein, Biofortification;
Apiculture and Animal husbandry.
Microbes in human welfare: In household food processing, industrial production, sewage treatment,
energy generation and as biocontrol agents and biofertilizers.

interactions–mutualism, competition, predation, parasitism; Population attributes–growth, birth rate and
death rate, age distribution.
Ecosystems: Patterns, components; productivity and decomposition; Energy flow; Pyramids of
number, biomass, energy; Nutrient cycling (carbon and phosphorous); Ecological succession; Ecological
Services– Carbon fixation, pollination, oxygen release.
Biodiversity and its conservation: Concept of Biodiversity; Patterns of Biodiversity; Importance of
Biodiversity; Loss of Biodiversity; Biodiversity conservation; Hotspots, endangered organisms, extinction,
Red Data Book, biosphere reserves, National parks and sanctuaries.
Environmental issues: Air pollution and its control; Water pollution and its control; Agrochemicals
and their effects; Solid waste management; Radioactive waste management; Greenhouse effect and global
warming; Ozone depletion; Deforestation; Any three case studies as success stories addressing environmental
issues.
